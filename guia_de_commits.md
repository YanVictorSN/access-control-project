# access-control-project

## Conventions
1. Semantic commit messages
- ``feat``: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- ``fix``: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- ``ci``: (changes to our CI configuration files and scripts)
- ``chore``: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
- ``docs``: (changes to the documentation)
- ``test``: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- ``style``: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- ``refactor``: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- ``perf``: (a code change that improves performance)
- ``build``: (changes that affect the build system or external dependencies)
- ``revert``: (reverts a previous commit)
- ``hotfix``: (immediate rectification or upgrade of already deployed software)

2. Git branch naming conventions
- all lowercase
- only dashes (-) to separate words
- [author name]/[feat | fix | ci | chore | docs | test | style | refactor | perf | build | revert | hotfix]/[description in dash case]
- please keep it short

3. Pull Request naming conventions
Please follow the following syntax
[feat | fix | ci | chore | docs | test | style | refactor | perf | build | revert | hotfix]: description

4. Keeping git commits small, meaningful and limited to just one change. If you have more changes in your Merge request, create separate commit for each one.
